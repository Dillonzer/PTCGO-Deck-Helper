# PTCGO-Deck-Helper
Currently in beta, this tool helps you track your prizes! I do have more plans down the line with what it can do but since Direwolf Alpha won't give us a Game-State log this is the first step in the direction of building deck tracker tools.

## How to Install
Download the release `PTCGO-Deck-Helper-v.X.X.X.zip` file from the [Latest Release](https://github.com/Dillonzer/PTCGO-Deck-Helper/releases) and extract it to somewhere you would usually put applications. From there just launch `PTCGO-Deck-Helper.exe` and presto!

## How to Use
1. You will need to copy the PTCGO deck your are playing to your clipboard from PTCGO itself. Once you have that copied, just click `Import Decklist`.
1. Click on the `Set Prizes` button. 
1. Use `Left Click` to select a card (bring the number down) and `Right Click` to put the card back (put the number back up)
1. Once you have chosen your 6 prizes, click `Submit Prizes`.
1. When you draw the prize, just click the image. It will turn to full opacity noting you now have access to it.
1. If you are playing another game with the same deck just start from step 2.

## User Settings
- If you'd like to reverse the way prizes are highlighted go to Settings > Reverse Prize Highlighting and check it off

## Other Information
I've decided to make this fully open-source since I think us as a community can make this amazing. Feel free to open issues, fork and create your own tools, or even fork and create Pull Requests to make this one better.
