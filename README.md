# PTCGO-Deck-Helper
Currently in beta, this tool helps you track your prizes! I do have more plans down the line with what it can do but since Direwolf Alpha won't give us a Game-State log this is the first step in the direction of building deck tracker tools.

## How to Install
Download the release .zip file and extra it to somewhere you would usually put applications. From there just launch `PTCGO-Deck-Helper.exe` and presto!

## How to Use
1. You will need to copy the PTCGO deck your are playing to your clipboard from PTCGO itself. Once you have that copied, just click `Import Decklist`.
1. After figuring out your prize cards, select them from the drop down boxes and click `Set`. 
1. When you draw the prize, just click the image. It will turn to full opacity noting you now have access to it.
1. If you are playing another game with the same deck, just click `Reset Prizes` and you can re-do them. Otherwise start from step 1 again.

## Other Information
I've decided to make this fully open-source since I think us as a community can make this amazing. Feel free to open issues, fork and create your own tools, or even fork and create Pull Requests to make this one better.
